\section{Variational Structure}
Just as in the case of the original Swift-Hohenberg equation (Eq. \ref{eq:SH}), this modified equation can be expressed in terms of a Lyaponuv functional as 
where
\beqn
F[u]=
\eeqn
This implies that the system will always approach a steady state in time, and we can focus on time-independent solutions to give some insight into the dynamics of the system.
