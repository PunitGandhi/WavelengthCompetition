\section{Numerical Results}
The steady state solutions of this system as a function of the forcing strength $r$ can be found by numerical continuation.  Auto was used to compute the below bifurcation diagram and solutions.  We have used a domain size of 20 wavelengths for these simulations, but made use of the reflection symmetry to only simulate half (i.e. our simulation had a spatial size of 20$\pi$).
